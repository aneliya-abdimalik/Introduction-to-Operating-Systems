# Introduction-to-Operating-Systems
This repo contains three major assignments that explore key OS concepts such as interprocess communication, concurrency control, and file system internals.

## Projects Overview

1. **Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe Game** (hw1)
   - Implement a real-time, multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe server using bidirectional pipes and IPC.
   - Learn serverâ€“client communication patterns, non-blocking I/O with `select()`/`poll()`, and process management.

2. **Store (Concurrent Programming)** (hw2)
   - Build a thread-safe market store simulation handling suppliers and customers.
   - Practice synchronization primitives (mutexes, semaphores, condition variables) to enforce ordering and avoid deadlock.

3. **File System Chronology in an EXT2 File System** (hw3)
   - Develop a tool to reconstruct filesystem history from an ext2 image.
   - Dive into superblocks, inodes, directory entries, and timestamp analysis to reveal past filesystem actions.
